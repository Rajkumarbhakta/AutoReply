const val HOW_IT_WORKS = "<h2>How Auto Reply Works</h2>\n" +
        "<p>Auto Reply is an intelligent application designed to automate your responses to incoming messages across various messaging platforms. When you receive a message, Auto Reply detects it and, based on your configured settings, sends a predefined or customized reply on your behalf. This is particularly useful when you are busy, driving, in a meeting, or simply want to manage your notifications efficiently.</p>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of how it typically works:</strong></p>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><h4>1. Permissions:</h4> Upon installation, the app will request necessary permissions, such as Notification Access to read incoming message notifications and potentially SMS permissions if it supports replying to SMS.</p>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><h4>2. Configuration:</h4></p>\n" +
        "<ul>\n" +
        "<li><strong>Enable/Disable:</strong> Toggle the auto-reply service on or off.</li>\n" +
        "<li><strong>App Selection:</strong> Choose which apps to monitor and respond to (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, SMS).</li>\n" +
        "<li><strong>Reply Message:</strong> Set a default reply message (e.g., \"I'm busy right now, I'll get back to you later.\") or create custom replies for specific contacts or keywords.</li>\n" +
        "<li><strong>Contact Specific Replies:</strong> Set different replies for different contacts or groups.</li>\n" +
        "<li><strong>Time Delays:</strong> Add delay before replying again to the same contact to avoid spamming.</li>\n" +
        "<li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Schedule when auto-reply should be active (e.g., work hours or weekends).</li>\n" +
        "</ul>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><h4>3. Message Detection:</h4> Once enabled, the app listens for notifications from selected messaging apps.</p>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><h4>4. Reply Execution:</h4></p>\n" +
        "<ul>\n" +
        "<li>Checks if the message is from an app you've enabled.</li>\n" +
        "<li>Finds the appropriate reply (default, custom, or contact-specific).</li>\n" +
        "<li>Sends the reply using notification actions or accessibility services.</li>\n" +
        "</ul>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p><h4>5. Logging/History (Optional):</h4> Some apps keep a log of sent auto-replies.</p>\n" +
        "\n" +
        "<p>Auto Reply acts like your personal assistant, ensuring senders get timely responses even when you're unavailable.</p>\n"
