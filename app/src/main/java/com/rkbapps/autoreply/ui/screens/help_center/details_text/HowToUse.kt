        "\n" +
        "<ul>\n" +
        "    <li><b>Notification Access:</b> This is crucial! Auto Reply needs this permission to see the notifications from your messaging apps (like WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, SMS, etc.). Without it, it won't know when you've received a message.</li>\n" +
        "    <li><b>How to enable:</b> The app will guide you to your phone's settings page. Look for \"Notification Access,\" find \"Auto Reply\" in the list, and toggle it on.</li>\n" +
        "    <li><b>Contacts Access (Optional):</b> Some features might need this to send replies to specific people.</li>\n" +
